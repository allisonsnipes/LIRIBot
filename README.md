# LIRI Bot

## Overview & Description

LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. This is my first back-end assignment, although it was challenging, it was very interesting to build.

## Requirements (required node packages)

### Node Packages
1. Dotenv: module that assists with loading variables from files in .env to process.env.
2. Request: allows the functionality to make http callbacks.
3. Moment.js: library for manipulating, formatting, and parsing time.
4. FS: node package already preinstalled
5. Axios: promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
